            <!--WBR ELEMENT FOR PROJECT 1-->
            <p> The first show, located <wbr>at the Catwalk Club, was the first of many that I ended up going to.
                It was my first "rave" and this show remains memorable still, to this day.
                This is where I fell in love with Knock2's music.
                He also introduced, months later, his debut EP, ROOM202.

            <h3>HARD SUMMER</h3>
            <p>My first festival, Hard Summer. 
                Knock2 was to perform at stage and I knew I had to get there early.
                It wasn't as intimate as his standalone sets where, but it was a great time.
                I was with friends who were curious about Knock2, because I couldn't stop talking about him LOL.
                Friends and I had a blast, but again, not as great as his standalone sets.

            <h3>THE SHRINE</h3>
            <p>The ROOM202 finale. It was my birthday, just turned 23.
                I actually met up with a dude who shared the same birthday!
                This was the last ROOM202 show of Knock2's tour.
                He sold out FOUR NIGHTS. I went to the third and he ended up recording that third day set.
                After he finished his set, he annouced his debut long play, <i>nolimit</i>.
