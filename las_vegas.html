            <p> Took a flight to Las Vegas, just to see this dude.
                Got a hotel, stayed there for three days.
                Since there's no real warehouses for raves, it's mostly just clubs out there, so that's where we went.
                I met a group, who ended up going with to the Shrine, that were also from CSUN.
                Small world after all.

            <p> Kicking it off with his ROOM202 tour, after his debut headline in LA, Knock2 set his sights on the rest of the US.
                Every show was sold out. This was just the beginning. Soon, his name would appear everywhere.
