            <h3>SECRET LOCATION</h3>
            <p> Got into my 99' Toyota Solara and drove 400+ miles up to Northen California.
                This was one of his last shows of this tour, up until he annouced another show in LA.
                So that's why I drove up to see Knock2. I don't have any photos that I took but that place was great.
                Got to see Knock2 up close on the decks.
                I had no clue where I was, but the oragnizers sent us a location to meet up.
                I prefer these "lesser" known places.

            <p> Not really San Francisco, but close enough. Oakland had the warehouses.
                Following towards the end of his tour, Knock2 heads up to Northen California.
